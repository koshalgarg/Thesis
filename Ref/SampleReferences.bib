	title = "Fast memory efficient local outlier detection in data streams",
	abstract = "Outlier detection is an important task in data mining, with applications ranging from intrusion detection to human gait analysis. With the growing need to analyze high speed data streams, the task of outlier detection becomes even more challenging as traditional outlier detection techniques can no longer assume that all the data can be stored for processing. While the well-known Local Outlier Factor (LOF) algorithm has an incremental version, it assumes unbounded memory to keep all previous data points. In this paper, we propose a memory efficient incremental local outlier (MiLOF) detection algorithm for data streams, and a more flexible version (MiLOF-F), both have an accuracy close to Incremental LOF but within a fixed memory bound. Our experimental results show that both proposed approaches have better memory and time complexity than Incremental LOF while having comparable accuracy. In addition, we show that MiLOF-F is robust to changes in the number of data points, the number of underlying clusters and the number of dimensions in the data stream. These results show that MiLOF/MiLOF-F are well suited to application environments with limited memory (e.g., wireless sensor networks), and can be applied to high volume data streams.",

	abstract="Outlier detection is concerned with discovering exceptional behaviors of objects. Its theoretical principle and practical implementation lay a foundation for some important applications such as credit card fraud detection, discovering criminal behaviors in e-commerce, discovering computer intrusion, etc. In this paper, we first present a unified model for several existing outlier detection schemes, and propose a compatibility theory, which establishes a framework for describing the capabilities for various outlier formulation schemes in terms of matching users'intuitions. Under this framework, we show that the density-based scheme is more powerful than the distance-based scheme when a dataset contains patterns with diverse characteristics. The density-based scheme, however, is less effective when the patterns are of comparable densities with the outliers. We then introduce a connectivity-based scheme that improves the effectiveness of the density-based scheme when a pattern itself is of similar density as an outlier. We compare density-based and connectivity-based schemes in terms of their strengths and weaknesses, and demonstrate applications with different features where each of them is more effective than the other. Finally, connectivity-based and density-based schemes are comparatively evaluated on both real-life and synthetic datasets in terms of recall, precision, rank power and implementation-free metrics.",
