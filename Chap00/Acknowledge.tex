I consider it as my privilege to express gratitude and respect to all those who guided
and inspired me in the B.Tech project. The undertaking of this project inculcated a
strong sense of research inside me, and I also came to know about so many new things.

\par 
First and foremost, I would like to express my gratitude to my supervisor Dr.
Bidyut Kumar Patra for helping me throughout this research. I am grateful to
him for his careful guidance, encouragement during my thesis work. I have surely
learnt a lot from him. I am also thankful to all the faculties and supporting staff
of Department of Computer Science and Engineering for their constant help and
extending the departmental facilities for my project.


\par 
I would also like to keep in the record the moral and emotional support provided
by my parents and family throughout the period.
